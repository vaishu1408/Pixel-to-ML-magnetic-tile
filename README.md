# Magnetic Tile Defect Segmentation

This project focuses on segmenting surface defects on magnetic tiles using a UNet-based deep learning model.  
The goal is to automatically identify cracks, blowholes, frays, uneven surfaces, and other defect regions at the pixel level.


## 1. Project Overview
Each image in the dataset contains a grayscale tile surface with a known defect.  
A corresponding ground-truth mask highlights the exact defective region.  
The model learns this relationship and predicts a binary mask for new images.

This helps automate visual inspection, reduce manual review time, and improve defect-detection reliability.


## 2. Dataset Pipeline
The dataset is organized by defect type:

data/raw/images/
MT_Blowhole/
MT_Crack/
MT_Fray/
MT_Uneven/

Inside each folder:
- `.jpg` - grayscale input image  
- `.png` - ground-truth binary mask  

The pipeline:
1. Scans all folders.
2. Pairs each grayscale image with its matching mask.
3. Converts them into tensors and resizes them.
4. Sends them into the model for training and analysis.

This ensures consistent preprocessing across all defect categories.


## 3. Model Used: UNet
A UNet architecture is used for segmentation because:
- it captures fine-grained texture details  
- skip connections help preserve spatial information  
- it performs well on small to medium-sized datasets  
- it is widely used in industrial defect detection tasks  

UNet is a strong baseline for pixel-level prediction and works well for grayscale manufacturing images.


## 4. Sample Predictions
Below are example outputs generated by the model:

### **Raw Input**
_(grayscale surface image)_

### **Predicted Mask**
_(binary defect region)_

### **Overlay Output**
_(mask applied as a red highlight)_

### **Side-by-Side Visualization**
_(raw - mask - overlay)_

All generated samples are stored in:

sample_results/

These visual results make it easy to evaluate segmentation quality without running the full pipeline.

## 5. Summary
This project demonstrates:
- a clean dataset pairing pipeline  
- a UNet segmentation model tailored for surface-defect analysis  
- clear prediction outputs for visual inspection  

It serves as a strong foundation for classical vision - ML-based inspection systems in manufacturing environments.
